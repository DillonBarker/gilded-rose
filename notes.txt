Notes

- Read, refactor and extend challenge

Challenge:
    Basic points:
    - All items have a SellIn value - denoting the num of days left to sell item
    - All items have a Quality value, denoting value
    - At the end of each day, quality is lowered and SellIn is lowered 
    
    More:
    - Once sell by date is passed, quality decreases by 2
    - Quality > 0
    - Aged Brie increases in quality (reversed)
        * by 2 when 10 days or less
        * by 3 when 5 days or less
        * drops to 0 after concert
    - Quality <= 50
    - Sulfuras is legendary (immune to Quality and SellIn)
    
    Extra:
    - Conjured items degrade twice as fast in quality

Outline:
- Can make changes to the UpdateQuality method, and add new code here if needed
- Do not alter the item class or items property
- Can make the method and items property static if needed.
